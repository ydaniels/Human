# Human
This is a very large social media bot framework for internet marketers, social media marketers and digital marketers. This bot would support Instagram, Facebook , Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest and Stumbleupon Using a Meta Programming, Modular And Plugin Software Architecture And Also Some Machine Learning.

# What is Human
Human is a bot ( SM ) framework that tries everything possible to bypass bot detection on social media site. If you can use machine learning to detect a bot activities then it should be possible to use machine learning to avoid detection. 

#Why Framework
Human is not really a bot , it is just a marketing tool that uses manchine learning to achieve and automate social media marketing activies i.e from content generation, viral marketing, content scheduling , keyword monitoring , analaytics , optimization and anything you can think of.

#Why The Bot.
Well it simply automates everything . Yes Everything from registration, verification , profile updates , re-verification , normal social media activities like (following, liking,rebloging ,posting,tweeting e.t.c .. ) content generation, a/b testing, group spamming, content scheduling , calendar, tracking, short links, article generation and summarization for website , trend and viral detection . etc.

#How
The only thing Human understands is data generation from one end point , data manipulation (filtering, building, cleaning, reproducing )  and  data submission to another endpoint.

#For Example Let Us Use Human As Facebook Spamming Bot.
Step 1 Create Facebook Bot
- Tell it you want to use facebook
- Tell it how to use facebook i.e api,web interface or another external library
- Provide where to get your information to access facebook or tell it to register , update profile and verify .
- Provide how to use the api (Human would automatically build a software bot from it)
- Tell it to get content from pinterest 
- Tell it to apply some filter and transformation to the content
- Tell it to post it on your website
- Then post the content link on your website to provided facebook groups ( also tell it to get the facebook from a particular place and filter bad groups )
-Tell it to do it every hour on tuesday and wednesday and tell it to login sometimes with the web interface and do what normal human bieng do.
-Tell human to work in a cyborg mode that is some action would be verified by before they proceed or do everything o its own ( cannot guarantee quality .Hey who cares am spamming ). Or better still do everything yourself

You see you just provide the  human steps and it does everything for you.

#But That Can easily be detected as a Bot Activities.
Human can also use manchine learning to detect how people behave  on a particular social media and also behave like that . Yea it can detect other bots too and avoid them or report them to be banned. 
Feeling lazy use the copycat mode pass in a real human account and it copies the person activities and uses that. 

#No Technical Knowledge or Very Long steps Just to Avoid Detection
Some default modules would be provided already support for facebook,twitter, stumbleupon ,instagram, pinterest and tumblr. And every topics or area mentioned above.
Better still write your own module (support for other social media and other interesting stuff) and plug it in the system and tell it how to use. Thank you
